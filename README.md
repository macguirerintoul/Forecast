## What is it?

Forecast is an app that helps you keep track of the tasks you have coming up. When you add items to your Forecast, it will show you which items are due first, and how long you have left to complete each item. Or, you could use it to count down the days to your next vacation ðŸ˜‰

## How does it work?

When you add an item to your Forecast, you give it a title and a date. Then, Forecast ranks your items by date (earliest first) to try and help you decide what you should work on.
